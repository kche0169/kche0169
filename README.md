## The fields I'm currently interested in💬
>  I have a broad range of interests in computer science, particularly in the following areas
1. **Single-Agent & Multi-Agent Planning and Decision Making**  
   - I am particularly interested in the field of Single-Agent and Multi-Agent Planning and Decision Making, with a focus on developing intelligent systems capable of autonomous decision-making and efficient problem-solving in dynamic environments.
   - ~~I am currently participating in a multi-agent planning competition [Robot Runners](https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/), where the goal is to enable agents to collaborate or compete in complex environments. I am looking for like-minded individuals to join, collaborate, and tackle the challenges together.~~
     > ~~If you have interested in this competition, please contacted with me.~~
2. **Operating Systems & Low-Level Programming**  
   I am fascinated by how operating systems work under the hood, and I enjoy contributing to projects that involve **Rust** and **C** to build fast and reliable systems software, particularly in memory management, scheduling, and system calls.
3. **Database Systems & Storage Engine**  
   I am currently interning at a database company, where my main responsibility is developing an open-source vector database. At the same time, I am deepening my understanding of database kernel principles and technologies to continuously enhance my professional skills and development capabilities.

## Looking forward to learning🌱
   1. I am interested in the design and optimization of distributed systems.
   2. I am learning to use go to create fun toy projects.
