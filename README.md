## Hi there I'm kche aka ShiraTake👋

## 我目前感兴趣的领域💬
>  I have a broad range of interests in computer science, particularly in the following areas
1. **Single-Agent & Multi-Agent Planning and Decision Making**  
   I am particularly interested in the field of Single-Agent and Multi-Agent Planning and Decision Making, with a focus on developing intelligent systems capable of autonomous decision-making and efficient problem-solving in dynamic environments.
   I am currently participating in a multi-agent planning competitionp[Robot Runners](https://www.leagueofrobotrunners.org/), where the goal is to enable agents to collaborate or compete in complex environments. I am looking for like-minded individuals to join, collaborate, and tackle the challenges together.

3. **Operating Systems & Low-Level Programming**  
   I am fascinated by how operating systems work under the hood, and I enjoy contributing to projects that involve **Rust** and **C** to build fast and reliable systems software, particularly in memory management, scheduling, and system calls.


## Looking forward to learning🌱
