## 我目前感兴趣的领域💬
>  I have a broad range of interests in computer science, particularly in the following areas
1. **Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning**  
   I am passionate about developing intelligent systems that can learn and adapt. My interests include deep learning, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, and AI applications in automation and decision-making.

2. **Operating Systems & Low-Level Programming**  
   I am fascinated by how operating systems work under the hood, and I enjoy contributing to projects that involve **Rust** and **C** to build fast and reliable systems software, particularly in memory management, scheduling, and system calls.

3. **Concurrency & Distributed Systems**  
   I am interested in designing and optimizing systems for **concurrency** and **distributed computing**, particularly in the areas of multi-threading, task scheduling, and building fault-tolerant systems. I strive to create applications that are scalable, efficient, and can handle high loads.

4. **Programming Languages & Systems Design**  
   I'm particularly drawn to **Rust** for its combination of safety and performance. I am constantly exploring new ways to design software systems that are both robust and highly optimized, with a focus on low-level memory management and system performance.

5. **Computer Networks & Security**  
   I have a keen interest in **network security**, from securing communication protocols to defending against cyber threats. I am also interested in **cryptography**, building secure network architectures, and understanding the vulnerabilities that exist in modern systems.
